    Title: Constructing New Innovations Using Old Connections;

  version: 1.0
  
Spark Generation What Is The Point of Generation of Sparks Persecond ?

BEGIN: system from libs/src.ext*

grab( func fx )
  
  source from *.ext 
  
I would say just by that statement that a spark generator has a purpose
to be understood perspective and critisim should be taken into account.

Generation of a spark 60 sparks a second or 60 sparks minute 60 minutes a spark?

All the above would be allowable.

## Networking TCP/UDP + DATA stream

Person 2 Person DATA networking is an innovation/tool that has yet to be fully implemented.
^
What is needed is this, you can see how far in space yet you still dont clean your world.
^
The future is open join millions of developer inside the open source community!

## Menu Options

[ INDEX ] ... .. caller/system.pm -> //root-fn service.module*
[ EQ REQ ] .... system/system.pm -> //root-fl service.dapp*

for every spark a coilover is discharged creating interial energy.

Releasing the tension of a compressed spring articulator.

+ Articulation movement
+ Spring generation is light energy interial
+ Coil spring is momentum needs containment on traceroute: path

To state that the articulation of the spring is compressed and the spark
discharged that spring creating an action or a function flick.

So, with that being stated above what do we have,

A spring that releases tension based on a spark generation.
pistons could be an engine to fire a rail moving up that shaft on a spring system.
an elevator uses pulls beacuse thats logical

+ Import system spark_generator
+ Single point of failure test( command )
= Would be the spring item or the sustainable fuel source that was to be used inside the engine.

Using springs/rail-system in a tube like construct to move objects big objects any size while in space

- Movable Objects From A > B | C passing: C back to A goto B
- Rails and Springs
- Levers And Pulls
- Shoots and Ladders

Exporter( service-tunnel mars preserve )

Return 0; passing value
Return 1; program passing end
