(FTL)

## First Token Language 

Was inspired by Perl, Regex & many other languages. A Token Based Machine Learning Language System.

```
1. !/  = declare.strings
2. @/  = id.command
3. #/  = display.comment
4. $/  = value.key
5. %/  = split.objective
6. ^/  = peek.display
7. &/  = runtime.ext
8. */  = permissions.env
9. (/  = opening.paren
0. )/  = closed.paren
```
##  "Block Stepping" Verification Process

A pattern can be seen throughout the matrix block.
Stepping down the FTL matrix block you can see the verification highlighted.
Each row is different and unique.
each token has value and meaning.
Token generation is a sequencial pattern.

```
!!/ declare.strings.verification
@@/ id.command.verification
##/ display.comment.verification
$$/ value.key.verification
%%/ split.objective.verification
^^/ peek.display.verification
&&/ runtime.ext.verification
**/ permissions.env.verification
((/ opening.paren.verification
))/ closed.paren.verification
```
## FTL Matrix Block
This is the keyblock matrix used for the language.
Each end row tells about what is comming NeXt.

```
         '! @ # $ % ^ & * ( !)'
'!! !@ !# !$ !% !^ !& !* !( @)'
'@! @@ @# @$ @% @^ @& @* @( #)'
'#! #@ ## #$ #% #^ #& #* #( $)'
'$! $@ $# $$ $% $^ $& $* $( %)'
'%! %@ %# %$ %% %^ %& %* %( ^)'
'^! ^@ ^# ^$ ^% ^^ ^& ^* ^( &)'
'&! &@ &# &$ &% &^ && &* &( *)'
'*! *@ *# *$ *% *^ *& ** *( ()'
'(! (@ (# ($ (% (^ (& (* (( !))'
```
